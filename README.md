This repo contains code and other relevant materials of my Bachelor thesis *Best View Synthesis of 3D models* at Peking University, supervised by Prof. Dr. Lian Zhouhui.
- ./image_synthesis contains code for novel view synthesis. The backbone of code is borrowed from [VON](https://github.com/junyanz/VON)
- ./rendering contains scripts for rendering 3D model from synthesized images
