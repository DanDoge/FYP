This repo contains code and other relevant materials of my Bachelor thesis *Best View Synthesis of 3D models* at Peking University, supervised by Prof. Dr. Lian Zhouhui.
- ./image_synthesis contains code for novel view synthesis. The backbone of code is borrowed from [VON](https://github.com/junyanz/VON)
- ./rendering contains scripts for rendering 3D model from synthesized images

Please find more details in the [project page](https://dandoge.github.io/projects/2020/06/01/best_view_synthesis_of_3d_objects/), or refer to my [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/DanDoge/FYP/blob/gpu_0201_without_pair/thesis/template/%E6%9C%AC%E7%A7%91%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87_%E5%AF%BC%E5%B8%88%E8%AF%84%E9%98%85%E8%A1%A8_%E9%BB%84%E9%81%93%E5%90%89_1600017857.pdf)(in Chinese).
